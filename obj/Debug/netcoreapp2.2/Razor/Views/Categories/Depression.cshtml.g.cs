                    Everything feels more challenging when you're dealing with depression. Going to work, socializing with friends, or even just getting out of bed can feel like a struggle.

                    But there are some things you can do to cope with your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Here are eight tips for living with depression.

                    One of the most important things you can do to help yourself with depression—other than medication and therapy—is to develop strong social support.<br />

                    Reduce Your Stress

                <p style=""font-size:large"">
                    When you're under stress, your body produces more of a hormone called cortisol. In the short-term, this is a good thing because it helps you gear up to cope with whatever is causing the stress in your life.<br />
                    Over the long run, however, it can cause many problems for you, including depression.﻿The more you use techniques to reduce stress, the better because it will reduce your risk of becoming depressed.<br />

                    Sleep and mood are intimately related. A 2014 study found that 80% of people with major depressive disorder experience sleep disturbances.<br />
                    But, you might feel like you just can't fall asleep. Or perhaps you struggle to get out of bed because you feel exhausted all the time.<br />
                    Good sleep hygiene could be key to improving the quality and quantity of your sleep.<br />
                    Turn off electronics at least an hour before you go to bed. Use dim light to read a book or engage in another relaxing activity.<br />
                    Only use your bed for sleep and sexual activity. Doing work in bed, or even in your bedroom, can cause you to associate your bed with stress, rather than relaxation.<br />
